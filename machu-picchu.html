                        <h3>Machu Picchu:</h3>
                        <p>Machu Picchu was built by the Inca civilization, likely around the mid-15th century,
                            during the reign of the Inca emperor Pachacuti. Its construction is estimated to have
                            taken approximately 100 years, with the site serving as both a royal estate and a
                            ceremonial center. The exact purpose of Machu Picchu remains a subject of debate
                            among scholars. Some theories suggest that it served as a royal retreat or a religious
                            sanctuary, while others propose that it had astronomical or agricultural significance. It's
                            likely that Machu Picchu fulfilled multiple functions, including as a residence for the Inca
                            elite, a center for religious rituals, and a site for agricultural experimentation.</p>

                        <h3>History</h3>
                        <p>Although local indigenous populations were aware of the existence of Machu Picchu, it
                            remained largely unknown to the outside world until it was rediscovered by the
                            American explorer Hiram Bingham in 1911. Bingham, along with a team of
                            archaeologists and locals, uncovered the overgrown ruins and brought international
                            attention to the site.

                            millions of visitors each year to marvel at its breathtaking scenery and ancient ruins.
                            Efforts have been made to manage tourism and preserve the site's fragile ecosystem
                            and archaeological remains, including implementing visitor limits, conservation
                            measures, and sustainable tourism practices.</p>

                            It's believed to have medicinal properties and is often consumed to alleviate symptoms
                            of altitude sickness. Mate de coca is widely available in Cusco and is served hot or cold.</p>
