                        <h3>History : </h3>
                        <p>The Chimú civilization emerged around the 9th century AD in the Moche Valley region
                            of northern Peru. Initially, it was a small kingdom, but it gradually expanded its influence
                            through conquest and alliances with neighboring societies</p>
                        <p>By the 11th century, the Chimú capital, Chan Chan, began to take shape as a
                            monumental urban center. Its construction was likely initiated by the Chimú ruler
                            Tacaynamo. Over the following centuries, successive Chimú rulers expanded and
                            embellished Chan Chan, turning it into one of the largest and most impressive cities of
                            its time. Chan Chan was meticulously planned, with a grid-like layout consisting of nine
                            large compounds known as "citadels." Each citadel was surrounded by high walls and
                            contained palaces, temples, warehouses, and residential areas. The architecture of
                            Chan Chan was characterized by its massive adobe brick structures adorned with
                            intricate carvings and friezes depicting geometric patterns, mythological figures, and
                            scenes from daily life</p>

                        <h3>Places</h3>
                        <p>Chan Chan is considered one of the largest pre-Columbian cities in the Americas,
                            covering an area of approximately 20 square kilometers (7.7 square miles). It was built
                            entirely out of adobe, a material made from sun-dried mud bricks. The city was
                            organized into nine major citadels, each with its own compounds, temples, reservoirs,
                            and storage facilities.</p>

                        <h3>Food and Drinks</h3>
                        <p>While Chan Chan was an ancient city and not known specifically for its cuisine, we can
                            infer some traditional foods and drinks that might have been consumed by the people of
                            the Chimú civilization based on archaeological evidence and the culinary practices of
                            the region.</p>
